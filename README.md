## QNAP Store

You can ease installation of updates by adding my repositories on your QNAP settings.

There is two repositories : 

- `Releases` [https://pdulvp.github.io/qnap-store/repos.xml](https://pdulvp.github.io/qnap-store/repos.xml) to retrieve only stable releases

- `Pre-Releases` [https://pdulvp.github.io/qnap-store/repos-prereleases.xml](https://pdulvp.github.io/qnap-store/repos-prereleases.xml), to retrieve updates that are marked as 'pre-releases'.

(note: in both cases, the applications are not always field tested)

In the `Settings` of the `AppCenter` on your QNAP
